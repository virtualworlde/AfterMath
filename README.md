Do you know, just how damn terrible it is livin' sleeping in a bomb-shelter through a solar catastrophe; and hoping to God thatcha DON'T DIE? Well, hey, welcome to my world! Or what I like to call "hell". Not to mention, also the place that those stupid "Doomsday Preppers" can now victor in. God knows if any of those damn hoes are still alive even! But, hey, my arse is still here, so good luck try'na find me!
